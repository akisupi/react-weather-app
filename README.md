# About the project
This is my fourth react project as part of my journey to mastering react .
In this project, I used key react development concepts like **hooks** (`useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`), **props and prop drilling** and more.
I also consumed two APIs i.e the weather API and geolocation API.
I used `Tailwindcss` for styling the app
I followed best development practices like drawing the app wireframe, and breaking down different parts of the app into different components for easy maintainability.
I also well documented my code.
I securely kept API keys by keeping thwm in .env files so that they are not leaked or uploaded to GitHub.
I handled errors properly.
I used `Git` for `version control`
Finally, my app is in `production` on vercel. [take a look](https://react-weather-app-eosin-one.vercel.app/)
